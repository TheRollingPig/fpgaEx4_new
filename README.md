# fpgaEx4_new
1. refer to the fpgaEx4.doc for detialed requirements.
2. in this excerise, you will design a cortex m0+ based soc system with your uart module from fpgaEx2 and a GPIO module.
3. you will also write some C program in Keil/IAR to test your system and your uart module.
4. you will compile & simulate your system with VCS & Verdi by bash scripts.
4. design follow:
    -> system archeticture design(bus structure/memory map/pin multiplex) 
    -> system integration 
    -> C programing
    -> system verification (mix language verilog & C)
